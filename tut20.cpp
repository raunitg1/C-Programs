/* ******************Object Oriented Programming*********************
As we know C++ is a succesor of C language. C was without oop. So when Bjarne Stroustrup created C++,
It was know by name 'C with classes*. So OOP is nothing but Classes and object in C++ which is used to reduce
size of the program.

Suppose if OOP is not present and we want to create a program to take data of Students like their---> name, age and gender
So, for 20 students we have to write a long code, Which can be impractical. 

For this case, we can use OOP. We can create a class of Student and then their name, age and gender will be attributes of that Class.

And suppose there is a student whose name is Raunit. We want to get information about Raunit.
We can use attributes of class. Raunit is object.
raunit.age=20

If we are not using OOP then program will be difficult to understand. So, OOP makes our program easier.
OOP also provide clear structure for the program.
 
*****Note------> OOP also use to make full reusable application.
For example--> We have a class with Student name. Now we want to create for Teacher's data too. 
We can use reusability feature of OOP. By this method we can use all objects of class or we can change any one of the object.

****************Procedure Oriented Programming*****************
In POP program is divided in small part called Function.
Data moves function to function.

Whereas OOP works on concept of object and classes.
A class is a template(which contain attributes) to create object.
